Although, if you like it enough to be worried about reading this fine print, can I suggest that you might also enjoy my novels? :-) Check them out at http://creativityhacker.ca/jbooks. Buying one would be like tipping your waiter, only you get sucked into a world of adventure in return. It's a total win-win.
